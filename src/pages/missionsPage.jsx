          Here you can see the missions that you have to carry out in order to
          have a great profile and become THE GUY OF GITHUB, some are very easy
          and others much more complex, but remember that the results come from
          effort, if you have already done all the missions Well, you just have
          to maintain your commit rate since from that moment on you will be
          considered THE GUY OF GITHUB. Good luck with your assignments
